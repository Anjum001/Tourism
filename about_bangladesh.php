		<h1>Beautiful Bangladesh</h1>
	<p>Bangladesh( "The nation of Bengal"), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh (Bengali: গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh), is a country located on the fertile Bengal delta in South Asia.
		It is bordered by India to its west, north and east, by Burma to its south-east and by the Bay of Bengal to its south. It is separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the narrow Chicken's Neck. 
		Bangladesh has the world's eighth-largest population with more than 160 million people, also making it one of the world's most densely populated countries. 
		Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh and also one of the world's largest cities. Bangladesh is also known as "the land of rivers".
		 Together with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura, it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal.

		<h1>History</h1>
		<p><img src="img/map.gif" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
			Bangladesh forms the Bengal delta region in the Indian subcontinent, where civilization dates back more than 4,300 years. 
			The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established during the British-partition of Bengal and India in 1947, when the region became East Pakistan, part of the newly formed state of Pakistan. 
			It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,600 km (994 mi) of Indian territory. Due to political, economic and linguistic discrimination, popular agitation and civil disobedience grew against the Pakistani state.
			 Led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bengali people increasingly demanded self-determination, culminating in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.

 

             The People’s Republic of Bangladesh—was founded as a constitutional, secular, democratic, multiparty, parliamentary republic. 
             After independence, Bangladesh endured periods of poverty and famine, as well as political turmoil and military coups.
             The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by economic progress and relative political calm.

 

             Geographically, modern Bangladesh straddles the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra delta and has an ancient, historic and rich cultural heritage intertwined with the larger history of the Indian subcontinent.
             It is a pluralistic nation of religious and ethnic diversity. It is the world's eighth most populous country, as well as one of the world's most densely populated countries.
             The republic is a parliamentary democracy, with an elected parliament called the Jatiyo Sangshad. Bangladesh is a founding member of SAARC, of which it is a pioneer and vocal promoter, the Developing 8 Countries, BIMSTEC and BCIM, as well as a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement. Bangladesh is also the world's largest contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions.</p>
		<h1>Geography</h1>
		<p><img src="img/sky.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: right">  <img src="img/boat.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: right">
			Bangladesh is in the low-lying Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna also known as "Yamuna"), and Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries.
		 The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The alluvial soil deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world.
		 Bangladesh has 57 trans-boundary rivers, making water issues politically complicated to resolve – in most cases as the lower riparian state to India.
		 Most parts of Bangladesh are less than 12 m (39.4 ft) above the sea level, and it is believed that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.28 ft).
         In southeast Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. By implementing cross dams, the natural accretion of silt has created new land.
         With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has since become a multiagency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers.
         By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some 27,000 acres (10,927 ha) to 21,000 families.
         </p>
         <h1>Climate</h1>
         <p><img src="img/71.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
          Straddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladeshi climate is tropical with a mild winter from October to March, and a hot, humid summer from March to June. 
     	  The country has never frozen at any point on the ground, with a record low of 4.5°C in the south west city of Jessore in the winter of 2011. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall.
     	 Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year, combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating. A cyclone that struck Bangladesh in 1991 killed some 140,000 people.
       </p>
       <h1>Language</h1>
       <p><img src="img/miner.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: right">
       	More than 98% of Bangladeshis speak Bangla (Bengali) as their mother tongue as it is the official language. English is also used as a second language among the middle and upper classes and is also widely used in higher education and the legal system.
        Historically, laws were written in English and were not translated into Bangla until 1987 when the procedure was reversed. Bangladesh's Constitution and all laws now both are in English and Bangla.
        There are also some amount of Indigenous minority language speakers.

       	<h1>Relagion</h1>
       	<p><img src="img/mosq.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: left">  <img src="img/Church.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
       		Islam is the largest religion of Bangladesh; Islam contributing 90.4% of population, Hinduism contributing 8.2% of the population, Buddhism contributing 0.7% of the population, Christianity with 0.6% and others of 0.1% of the population.
       		 The majority of Muslims are Sunni, roughly 4% are non-denominational Muslims and a small number are Shia. Bangladesh has the fourth largest Muslim population after Indonesia, Pakistan and India.

       		 <h1>Festival</h1>
       		 <p><img src="img/boi.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: right"> 
       		 	The Muslim holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, the Bengali New Year, Independence day, and Durga Puja by the significant Hindu community of Bangladesh, see the most widespread celebrations in the country.
       		  Other major Hindu festivals are Kali Puja, Saraswati Puja, and Krishna Janmashtami; alongside the Buddhist festival of Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, and Christmas, called Borodin ("Great day"), are all (except Saraswati and Kali Puja) national holidays.

Pohela Boishakh, the Bengali new year, is the major festival of Bengali culture and sees widespread festivities.
 Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only Pohela Boishakh comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). 
 Unlike holidays like Eid al-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is really about celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. 
 As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include Nabonno, and Poush porbon (festival of Poush), both Bengali harvest festivals.

Alongside these are national days like the remembrance of 21 February 1952 Language Movement Day (International Mother Language Day), Independence Day and Victory Day. On Language Movement Day, people congregate at the Shaheed Minar in Dhaka to remember the national heroes of the Bengali Language Movement, and at the Jatiyo Smriti Soudho on Independence Day and Victory Day to remember the national heroes of the Bangladesh Liberation War.
These occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. 
TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society can participate.
